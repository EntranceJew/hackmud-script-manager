# hackmud-script-manager
![Build Test](https://github.com/samualtnorman/hackmud-script-manager/workflows/Build%20Test/badge.svg)

Command made for [hackmud-environment](https://github.com/samualtnorman/hackmud-environment), which is a scripting environment for hackmud with minification, autocompletes / intellisense, and TypeScript support.

Also exposes the API the command uses.

I'll write a proper README at some point.
